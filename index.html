    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <br>
    <pre>
        So if you're lonely
        You know I'm here waiting for you
        I'm just a cross-hair
        I'm just a shot away from you
        And if you leave here

        You leave me broken, shattered I lie
        I'm just a cross-hair
        I'm just a shot, then we can die
        Ah-ah-ah
        I know I won't be leaving here
        With you

        I say, "Don't you know?"
        You say, "You don't know"
        I say
        "Take me out"
        I say, "You don't show"
        Don't move, time is slow

        I say
        "Take me out
        I say, "You don't know"
        You say, "You don't know"
        I say
        "Take me out"

        If I move, this could die
        If eyes move, this could die
        I want you
        To take me out

        I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
        Oh, I know I won't be leaving here
        I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
        I know, I won't be leaving here
        With you

        I say, "Don't you know?"
        You say, "You don't know"
        I say
        "Take me out"
        If I wane, this could die
        If I wait, this could die
        I want you

        To take me out
        If I move, this could die
        Eyes move, this can die
        Come on
        Take me out

        I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
        Oh, I know I won't be leaving here
        I know, I won't be leaving here (with you)
        I know, I won't be leaving here
        With you
